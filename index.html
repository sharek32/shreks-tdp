            <h2><header>Introduction</header></h2>
            <p>Welcome to this comprehensive guide. Whether you're new to programming or looking to expand your skills, this documentation will provide you with the knowledge you need to progress effectively.</p>
            <p>We will start with the fundamentals, progress to intermediate concepts, and touch on advanced topics to build a solid foundation for solving real-world problems.</p>
            <p>Below is your first line of code to print "Hello, World!", a classic way to begin your programming journey:</p>
            <code>print('Hello, world')</code>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Overview:</strong> This guide covers everything from the basics to advanced concepts, ensuring you understand the "why" behind each step.</li>
                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To provide a structured learning path, enabling you to become confident in programming and tackle real-world challenges.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2><header>Getting Started</header></h2>
            <p>Before diving into programming, you'll need to set up your environment:</p>
            <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Install the necessary software such as Python, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), or a text editor like Visual Studio Code or PyCharm. These tools will help you write and test your code efficiently.</p>
            <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Configure your environment by installing essential libraries and ensuring Python paths are set correctly. For example, use <code>pip install</code> to add libraries you may need later, such as <code>numpy</code> or <code>pandas</code>.</p>
            <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Run your first program by creating a file named <code>hello_world.py</code> and executing it with the following command:</p>
            <code>python hello_world.py</code>
            <p>These steps will ensure that you have a fully functional environment to begin coding with confidence.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Requirements:</strong> Learn about the hardware and software specifications you'll need to start programming effectively.</li>
                <li><strong>Installation:</strong> Follow detailed step-by-step instructions to set up your programming environment seamlessly.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2><header>Basic Concepts</header></h2>
            <p>This section introduces you to the core building blocks of programming. Mastering these will enable you to write functional and efficient code:</p>
            <p><strong>Variables:</strong> Variables are used to store data that your program can manipulate. Example:</p>
            <code>name = "John"<br>print(f"Hello, {name}!")</code>
            <p><strong>Data Types:</strong> Python supports various data types such as integers, floats, strings, lists, and dictionaries. Each type serves a unique purpose in your programs. Examples:</p>
            <code>age = 25  # Integer<br>height = 5.9  # Float<br>is_student = True  # Boolean<br>hobbies = ["reading", "coding"]  # List</code>
            <p><strong>Control Structures:</strong> Use conditional statements and loops to control the flow of your program. Examples include:</p>
            <code>if age >= 18:<br>    print("You are an adult.")<br><br>for hobby in hobbies:<br>    print(hobby)</code>
            <p>By mastering these concepts, you'll be able to create programs that can solve basic problems and automate repetitive tasks.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Variables:</strong> Learn how to store and manage different types of data effectively.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Types:</strong> Understand the different types of data, their characteristics, and how to use them in your programs.</li>
                <li><strong>Control Structures:</strong> Explore how to use conditions and loops to implement logic in your code.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2><header>Advanced Topics</header></h2>
            <p>Once you're comfortable with the basics, it's time to explore more complex topics that will allow you to build scalable and efficient applications:</p>
            <p><strong>Memory Management:</strong> Learn how Python handles memory allocation and garbage collection to optimize performance. This includes understanding reference counting and the use of the <code>gc</code> module. Example:</p>
            <code>import gc<br>gc.collect()</code>
            <p><strong>Concurrency:</strong> Understand how to run multiple tasks simultaneously using threading or asynchronous programming. This is especially useful for I/O-bound tasks or applications requiring multitasking. Example:</p>
            <code>import threading<br>def worker():<br>    print("Task executed by thread")<br>thread = threading.Thread(target=worker)<br>thread.start()</code>
            <p><strong>Error Handling:</strong> Learn how to write robust programs by handling errors gracefully using try-except blocks. Example:</p>
            <code>try:<br>    result = 10 / 0<br>except ZeroDivisionError:<br>    print("You can't divide by zero!")</code>
            <p>These advanced topics will enable you to write efficient, scalable, and error-resilient programs suitable for real-world applications.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Memory Management:</strong> Optimize your program's resource usage and understand garbage collection.</li>
                <li><strong>Concurrency:</strong> Learn to manage multiple processes effectively to enhance application performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> Ensure your programs can gracefully recover from unexpected issues.</li>
            </ul>
